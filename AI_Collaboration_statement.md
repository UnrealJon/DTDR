I worked extensively and deliberately with AI, and I’ve chosen not to conceal that in the formatting of my writings. AI has shown itself to be exceptionally good at taking a clear idea and a clear goal and articulating it at high quality, very quickly. That doesn’t replace thinking; it amplifies it. 

I appreciate that many may have reservations about research or other written creations produced with help from AI due to a) risks of hallucination; b) generation of content beyond the understanding of the creator that may therefore in reality be non-sensical; c) be seen as in some way "cheating" when content that in the past and without the use of AI have taken years of hard slog to assemble. My view is that not to make full use of AI subject to various precautions is to "throw the baby out with the bathwater". The necessary precautions that I have tried to adhere to are: double-check references and factual assertions made by AI; ensure that I understand or learn to understand new concepts that underpin any arguments either fully or at least sufficiently well to be able to recognise whether they make sense. In this regard I have found it especially helpful to make use of more than one high-level AI to provide critique of content as it evolves.

It also helps that the content and projects on which I have worked allow for validation through the implementation of repeatable experiments. Many of these have been included in this repository to enable open demonstration of the ideas presented.

In summary I have used AI as a responsive interlocutor — to explore formulations, test arguments, and sharpen clarity — while personally providing original ideas and intuitions, setting the direction, applying constraints, making corrections and taking responsibility for what survived. As previously mentioned I’ve deliberately left the cues of collaboration visible because removing them would give a false impression of how the work was done. 

To my mind when it comes to creative scientific content the relevant question is not whether AI has been involved, but whether the author understands the work and can defend it. I am pleased to be able to assert that I can.
