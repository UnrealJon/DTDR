# On AI Collaboration in Research

I have worked extensively and deliberately with AI, and I've chosen not to conceal that in the formatting of my writings. AI has shown itself to be exceptionally good at taking a clear idea presented to it with a clear goal and articulating it at high quality, very quickly. That doesn't replace thinking; it amplifies it.

I appreciate that many may have reservations about research or other written creations produced with help from AI due to: 
- (a) risks of hallucination; 
- (b) generation of content beyond the understanding of the creator that may therefore in reality be nonsensical; 
- (c) being seen as somehow "cheating" by accelerating what would traditionally require years of solitary effort. 

My view is that not to make full use of AI subject to various precautions is to "throw the baby out with the bathwater."

## Precautions and Principles

The necessary precautions that I have tried to adhere to are:

- **Double-check references and factual assertions** made by AI
- **Ensure that I understand, or learn to understand**, new concepts sufficiently well to judge their coherence
- **Make use of more than one high-level AI** to provide regular critique as content evolves

It also helps that the content and projects on which I have worked allow for validation through the implementation of repeatable experiments. Many of these have been included in this repository to enable open demonstration of the ideas presented.

## My Role and Responsibility

In summary, I have used AI as a responsive interlocutor — to explore formulations, test arguments, and sharpen clarity — while I provide original ideas and intuitions, set the direction, apply constraints, make corrections, and take responsibility for what survived. My background in reproductive medicine, neural systems, and machine learning implementation provides the domain expertise that guided these collaborations.

I've deliberately left the cues of collaboration visible because removing them would give a false impression of how the work was done.

## The Relevant Question

To my mind when it comes to creative scientific content, the relevant question is not whether AI has been involved, but whether the author understands the work and can defend it. I am pleased to be able to assert that I can.
