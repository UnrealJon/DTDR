# Results — Emergence Experiment

## Observation

Model behaviour does not degrade proportionally with coefficient removal.

Instead:

| Fraction | Behaviour |
|--------|------|
<5% | no semantic output |
5-40% | unstable fragments |
40-80% | partial structure |
>80% | coherent language |

## Interpretation

The DTDR representation distributes semantic information non-locally.
Inference capability emerges only when sufficient global information is present.

This differs from:

- pruning (local damage)
- hierarchical compression (coarse detail first)

and resembles associative memory reconstruction.

## Conclusion

DTDR stores function as a collective interference pattern rather than layered detail.
